# UI

The UI is server-rendered HTML with small browser JavaScript for polling and
copy interactions. Do not turn NeurOn into a heavy SPA unless the product shape
changes substantially.

## Main Page

Route:

```text
GET /
```

The main page contains:

- current user's active reservation
- target-first reservation form
- model groups under the selected target
- duration quick buttons plus custom duration
- per-target status cards
- reservations grouped under each target status card

## Target-First Model

The product is honest about the expensive unit: a shared runtime target.

Users choose:

1. Capacity target
2. Models they expect to use on that target
3. Duration

This avoids implying that model selection is a placement solver. A future
solver could invert this flow back to model-first if NeurOn owns enough data to
choose a target safely.

## Model Cards

Model cards show:

- display name
- context pill
- short description
- copy chips for the shortest alias, canonical ID, and other aliases

The shortest supported alias is rendered first and emphasized. The card does
not label it as "recommended alias" because the chip order carries that meaning
without extra text.

## Status Cards

Each target has its own status card showing:

- desired state
- observed state
- active users
- provider
- status message
- recent startup estimate, when available
- reservations for that target only

Reservations render compact model copy chips so users can quickly copy the
model ID or alias they should use.

## Polling

Defaults are production-friendly:

- Reservation detail: 10 seconds
- Main/admin status: 30 seconds

Local development can override these to faster values through environment
variables or compose defaults.
