# Purpose

This directory is an Open Knowledge Format bundle for NeurOn. OKF is a
human- and agent-friendly format based on markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
NeurOn uses it for design rationale, operational context, and implementation
knowledge that should survive the eventual split into a dedicated repository.

# Bundle Conventions

* `index.md` is the bundle entry point and progressive-disclosure listing.
* Every non-reserved concept document has YAML frontmatter with at least `type`.
* Concept documents use stable relative links where helpful.
* Body content stays structured with headings, lists, and code blocks.
* Unknown future frontmatter fields should be preserved.

# Scope

This bundle documents NeurOn, not the PreFer inference presets. PreFer-specific
GPU, model-download, and llama.cpp preset rationale belongs in the parent repo's
documentation.
