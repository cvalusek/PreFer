# Providers

Providers translate target desired state into concrete runtime operations.
Provider-specific names should stay inside provider config and adapters.

## CapacityProvider

The capacity provider interface is:

```ts
ensureTargetOn(target)
ensureTargetOff(target)
getTargetStatus(target)
forceStopTarget(target)
```

Implementations must surface errors through status messages and exceptions that
the reconciler can catch. They should not crash the app process.

## AWS ECS/ASG

The AWS provider is the production v1 provider. For a target desired on:

- Set Auto Scaling Group desired capacity to `1`.
- Set ECS service desired count to `1`.

For a target desired off:

- Set ECS service desired count to `0`.
- Set Auto Scaling Group desired capacity to `0`.

The provider does not create ECS services, ASGs, launch templates, AMIs, or
clusters. Those resources must already exist.

### Identifiers

ECS config:

- `cluster`: name or ARN
- `service`: name or ARN

ASG config:

- `autoScalingGroupName`: ASG name only

Auto Scaling APIs require `AutoScalingGroupName`; ARNs are not accepted for the
calls NeurOn uses.

### IAM

The task role needs, at a high level:

- `autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity`
- `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups`
- `ecs:UpdateService`
- `ecs:DescribeServices`

## Docker Compose

The Docker Compose provider exists for local development. It shells out to
`docker compose` with configured project and compose file arguments.

On:

```bash
docker compose ... up -d --no-build <service>
```

Off:

```bash
docker compose ... stop <service>
```

It intentionally does not build images or manage model downloads directly.

## LiteLLM

LiteLLM integration has two separate roles:

- `BackendConfigSync`: sync backend config when a target becomes healthy.
- `TrafficSource`: poll LiteLLM request logs for recent usage.

`BackendConfigSync` is not a capacity provider and not a generic notification
bus. It represents an outbound configuration sync interface for the proxy layer.
The current LiteLLM adapter is deliberately isolated because the exact admin API
shape may need adjustment across LiteLLM versions. Do not spread LiteLLM API
assumptions through the app.

## No-Op/Fake Providers

- No-op LiteLLM is used for local development when no LiteLLM API config exists.
- Fake capacity provider is used by tests and can be enabled for pure app
  development with `USE_FAKE_PROVIDER=true`.
