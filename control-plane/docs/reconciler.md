# Reconciler

The reconciler is the owner of infrastructure lifecycle transitions. Request
handlers mutate reservation state; they do not directly start or stop capacity.

## Loop

On every reconciliation pass:

1. Expire old reservations.
2. List active reservations.
3. Compute desired-on target IDs from active reservation target IDs.
4. Before turning off a previously-on target, poll LiteLLM traffic once when a
   traffic poller is configured.
5. Apply desired state through the `CapacityProvider`.
6. Read provider status.
7. Run the target health check when provider status says the target is running.
8. Store simple target status.
9. Sync LiteLLM when a target first becomes healthy.
10. Refresh runtime model IDs when a target is healthy.
11. Mark relevant active reservations failed if target provisioning fails.

## Desired State

Desired capacity is aggregate state:

- If at least one active reservation references a target, desired state is `on`.
- Otherwise desired state is `off`.

Ending one user's reservation only removes that user's contribution. It must not
stop a target that another active reservation still needs.

## Runtime States

The UI and API expose intentionally simple runtime states:

- `stopped`
- `provisioning`
- `healthy`
- `stopping`
- `failed`

Do not add detailed startup phases unless they are needed for user decisions.

## Traffic Check Before Shutdown

LiteLLM request-log polling normally runs on an interval. The reconciler also
performs one immediate traffic poll before shutting down a target that was
previously desired-on. This gives last-minute traffic a chance to create or
refresh the synthetic `traffic` reservation before capacity is stopped.

The keepalive still cannot resurrect a failed target by itself. It only extends
capacity that is already healthy or currently needed by a real active
reservation.

## Startup Estimates

Target status stores recent provisioning-to-healthy durations in memory. The UI
uses these samples to show an estimate like:

```text
Start: usually 2m, range 1m-10m
```

The estimate is intentionally observational:

- It uses recent local samples only.
- It resets on NeurOn restart.
- It is not used for scheduling or capacity decisions.

## Error Handling

Provider errors must not crash the app. The reconciler catches provider errors,
marks the target failed, and fails active reservations that need the target.
