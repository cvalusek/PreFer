# AGENTS.md

Context for AI agents and future humans working on NeurOn.

## Project Overview

NeurOn is a lightweight internal control plane for shared self-hosted LLM
capacity. Developers reserve capacity targets and models, and a reconciler keeps
the required runtime capacity on while demand exists.

This directory is intended to split into its own repository later. Avoid adding
new dependencies on parent PreFer files unless the integration is explicitly
local-development-only.

## Product Principles

- Target-first UX is intentional. A target is the expensive shared runtime.
- Model choices express user intent; they are not a capacity solver.
- Multiple users can overlap on one target.
- Ending one reservation must not stop a target needed by another reservation.
- Keep runtime states simple: stopped, provisioning, healthy, stopping, failed.
- `modelsMax` is display/debug metadata only.

## Architecture Rules

- Request handlers mutate reservation state only. Infrastructure lifecycle
  transitions belong to the reconciler.
- Keep AWS, Docker, and LiteLLM assumptions inside provider/integration
  adapters.
- Prefer the existing interfaces before adding new abstractions:
  `CapacityProvider`, `BackendConfigSync`, `ReservationRepository`,
  `AuthProvider`, `TrafficSource`, and `TargetStatusRepository`.
- v1 storage is in memory. Do not add SQLite/Postgres unless the task is
  explicitly about persistence.
- Use explicit service classes and typed interfaces over framework magic.

## Configuration Rules

- Config must work without mounting a file. Maintain the env-expanded target
  pattern documented in `docs/configuration.md`.
- Keep `CAPACITY_TARGETS_JSON` and `CAPACITY_TARGETS_FILE` working.
- For AWS, prefer `aws.cluster` and `aws.service` because ECS accepts names or
  ARNs. Keep `clusterName` and `serviceName` backward-compatible.
- ASG config uses `autoScalingGroupName`; the AWS APIs used here require the
  ASG name.
- Do not make PreFer preset parsing the production source of truth. It is a
  fallback/convenience path.

## UI Rules

- Server-rendered HTML plus small browser JavaScript only.
- Do not introduce React/Next/Vite SPA machinery.
- Main page status should stay grouped by capacity target.
- Model cards should preserve copy chips for aliases/IDs and context pills.
- Keep copy interactions usable without making the whole card ambiguous.

## Reconciler Rules

- Avoid crashing the app on provider errors.
- Before shutting down a previously-on target, keep the last-minute traffic poll
  behavior unless replacing it with a stronger traffic signal.
- Traffic keepalive must not resurrect failed targets by itself.
- Startup estimates are observational and in-memory. Do not use them for
  scheduling decisions.

## Testing

Run before handing off code changes:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Most lifecycle behavior should be tested with fake providers. Do not require AWS
or Docker for ordinary unit tests.

## Documentation

Update `docs/` when changing design rationale, config shape, provider behavior,
or reconciler semantics. The docs are part of the product surface for future
operators and agents.
